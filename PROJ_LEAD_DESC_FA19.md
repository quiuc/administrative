# Projects Lead

### Background on the Goals of the Team

The projects team's ultimate goal is to support the exploration of the field for our members and help each
other's skills and capabilities grow. The projects will be diverse, open-ended, and determined by peer interest,
and so there likely will not be significant overlap between what each group is working on. Teams will form together
based on mutual interest of a topic, and as an organization we *will absolutely not* dictate what projects should be
worked on or who should be apart of each group. Rather, as an organization we will provide logistical and technical
support as well as bring together a community to spark innovative ideas. Think of the QUIUC projects team as a QIS
incubator for UIUC students of all backgrounds.

### Responsibilities of the Projects Lead

The projects lead main focus will be to facilitate project group meetings and serve as a reliable mentor for our
members. He or she will need to form a small team of other knowledgable peers to serve as a resource during these
meetings as well. This person will assist groups in setting clear goals for their projects and help assure they are
successful and deliver an end result they can showcase to their peers, professors, and industry leaders. Along with
this, he or she will need to form a strong line of communication between professors and companies in the field, so
as to receive feedback and guidance from them on our projects as well as keep QUIUC visible to the QIS industry.

### Desired Qualities

- A junior, senior, or graduate student in Physics, CS, or ECE
- A solid grasp on quantum physics (likely taken physiscs 486/7 and beyond)
- A solid grasp on the fundamentals of computer science (likely taken at least CS 225, potentially 374 as well)
- Significant practical experience with QIS (research, QIS internship, personal studies, etc.)
- Patience and good debugging skills to be able to assist your peers in working out the kinks of their projects
  (think of the traits you would want in a TA during his/her office hours)
- Strong communication skills and the self-drive to come up with and implement team ideas without oversight
