# Education Lead

### Background on the Goals of the Team

The education team's main foucs is to build up newer members to be capable of working on projects,
as well as reinforce the skills and expose new topics or ideas to our more veteran members. The goal
of the education team is *not* to reinvent the wheel and try to replace long-standing QIS materials
such as the Nielsen and Chuang text or established courses such as Physics 486 Quantum Mechanics.
Rather, we seek to gather together the best of the best of what resources already exist, and *augment*
what they offer. We seek to introduce our members to the field, and inspire them to find their niche
where they can dive deep into what is out there in the world. Thus, the goal of the education team is
not to develop experts in the field, but to spark an interest in our members and support their endeavor.

### Responsibilities of the Education Lead

The education lead is ultimately responsible for guiding the education team to be successful in building
up and retaining newer members. This role offers a great deal of flexibility, and, as this is the first
semester we are running this organization, this person will need to be capable of forming their own ideas
and making decisions with autonomy. Most importantly, he or she must be well-organized and great at
communicating and working with their peers on the education team. The education lead will have many
responsibilities, and so it will not be feasible to handle education on his or her own. This person will
need to form together the core members of the team and cohesively form educational materials and workshop
plans for the semester.

### Desired Qualities

- A junior, senior, or graduate student in Physics, CS, or ECE
- A solid grasp on quantum physics (likely taken physiscs 486/7 and beyond), and the capability to audit
  and research the validity of our educational materials
- A solid grasp on the fundamentals of computer science (likely taken at least CS 225, potentially 374 as well)
- Practical or theoretical experience with QIS (research, QIS internship, personal studies, etc.)
- Ambition and the self-autonomy necessary to form new ideas and develop workshops without significant guidance
- Patience and strong communication skills to be capable of working well as a team

Even if you don't think you would make a great fit to lead the team--we would love to have you on board to help 
in any capacity you would like! Though the education lead provides the direction for the team, we still need 
enthusiastic and knowledgable students that want to build educational materials, provide support, and teach 
during workshops!
