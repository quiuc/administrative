# Summer/Fall 2019 QUIUC Internal Projects

These are just a few important projects to the organization that cover a wide
range of skills. Ideally multiple people could collaborate together on these
projects to be ready to welcome new members for Fall 2019. Most of the projects
are pretty open-ended, and would serve as a great opportunity to showcase your
teamwork and technical skills to employers.

We have a fair bit of experience with the tech stack required for each of the
projects and are able to offer tips and guidance as you go along as well if you
are diving into something new! We simply don't have the time to do it all ourselves
though, so we are looking for others with the ambition and drive to dive deep
and learn on their own.

***If you have any questions, ideas, or would like to work on a specific project,
then get in touch at info@quiuc.org!***

## Organization Logo/Branding

Let's make QUIUC have a recognizable brand! Someone who enjoys graphic design
that can create a simple, flat logo with Adobe Illustrator (or similar vector
drawing tools) and potentially even shirt or banner design as well. We would also
need someone to help create graphics for the website or other projects when
applicable.

## Organization Website

In the year 2019, the only way to effectively communicate a message is through
the web. We are looking for a responsive, clean website that can clearly state
our organizational purpose in a concise manner. Ideally, this website would also
have the capability to integrate event calendars, web forms, and and administrative
login page to manage org functions in one convenient place. Graphics would be a
nice touch as well.

#### Desired skills/experience

- React.js, HTML, and CSS experience
- Responsive design experience (media queries, flexbox, etc.)
- Flat front-end design expertise (Adobe suite, UX/routing best practices)

## Administrative Dashboard

We would like to make behind the scenes functionalities as seemless and automated
as possible to keep ourselves organized. Ideally we would have a database of our
members and be able to track useful data such as meeting attendance, project goals/progress,
and key skills. Furthermore, we would like to aggregate QIS events on campus into
one place, as well as have some tool to create forms (or automate some form creation
through Google Forms).

#### Desired skills/experience

- React.js, HTML, and CSS experience
- Simple REST API/database design expertise
- Data visualizations (D3.js, plot.ly, mpld3, etc.)
- Misc. (i.e. AWS Lambda, Google Forms API) experience to be able to aggregate
  data together

## Educational Tools

This is an open-ended project category. Certain visualizations/tools may be very
useful to our education team, and could be developed as needed or out of general
interest. Sample ideas include an interactive Bloch sphere, the ability to export
gate descriptions into a visual (QISKit does this already though), etc.

## Crowd-Sourced Organization Quantum Simulator

Scope of project TBD once we have brought our education and project leads on board.

## Cloud Hosted Quantum Simulator

Ideally, we would like to host the above simulator on the public cloud for ease of
access. The goal for this would be to serve as a convenient educational tool, with a
very simplistic set of features targeted towards beginners and workshop sessions.
This is a very CS intensive project and requires strong understanding of data structures,
algorithms, and systems programming fundamentals.

#### There are many aspects to achieving this:

- Creating a *domain specific language* (DSL), with similar syntax and features to
  hardware descriptive languages such as Verilog, to specify quantum circuit and input
  descriptions. This will incorporate basic aspects of programming language and compiler
  design.

- Deploying the simulator to a serverless cloud compute service (AWS lambda), and
  linking together each aspect of the project. This will require experience with designing
  rest API's and developing on AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, and S3 among
  others.

- Designing the front-end for a web portal to be able to queue tasks and view output/debugging
  information from the results of their simulation run. This will require experience working
  with REST API's and designing dynamic front-end applications with React. User Authentication,
  API key handling, web forms, and responsive design are all key here.
